Authenticated users are able to delete any recipe and update recipes in the home page through the use of the 'trash' icon and the 'update' button. By pressing the trash icon, it sends a DELETE request to the server that corresponds to that specific recipe widget's ID and deletes it from the database and the user interface. The update button sends a PUT request to the database and updates the corresponding recipe using its ID. 

All users are able to also search up recipes which does a GET request to Edamam's database and generates a list of recipes users can try out. 

Current and new users are able to login and create user accounts through the login page and registration page respectively. Users are able to add recipes through the 'Add Recipe' button in the 'Add Recipe' page where it sends a POST request to the MongoDB Database.

â€‹       In the navigation bar, all users are able to get into the login page. This is where current and new users are able to login and create user accounts.
